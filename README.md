2.  Obtain functional annotation labels of the PETase dataset (interpro, blastp)
3. Obtain activity labels of the PEtase dataset (suppinfo, docking, tools) 
4. Finish the PETase-specific mutation table features (biophysical features) for remaining dataset. 
5. Code MLP head on PEtase dataset to predict stability, expression, activity
6. Read on fine-tuning, finish reading papers
